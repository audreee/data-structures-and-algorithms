/* 
Given the head of a Singly LinkedList, write a method to modify the LinkedList such that the nodes from the second half of the LinkedList are inserted alternately to the nodes from the first half in reverse order. So if the LinkedList has nodes 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> null, your method should return 1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> null.

Your algorithm should use only constant space the input LinkedList should be modified in-place.

Example 1:

Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> 12 -> null
Output: 2 -> 12 -> 4 -> 10 -> 6 -> 8 -> null 

Example 2:

Input: 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 8 -> 10 -> null
Output: 2 -> 10 -> 4 -> 8 -> 6 -> null

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 10^4].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000

Time Complexity:
The time complexity of our algorithm will be O(N) where â€˜Nâ€™ is the number of nodes in the LinkedList.

Space Complexity:
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
